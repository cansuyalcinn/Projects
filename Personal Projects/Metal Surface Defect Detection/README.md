# Project Overview

This is a Metal Surface Detection project detects scratches and dents on metal surfaces by using different deep learning models and computer vision approaches. It was part of my work when during my internship. 

# Resources

**Data:** Data is collected from factories during the production of metal parts. 
**Python version:** 3.7
**Packages/software tools:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, tensorflow, keras, Google Colab, LabelImg

# Conclusion
Defective areas were determined using image segmentation. Scratches and dents showed red and beige colors respectively.
