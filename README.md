# Cansu Yalçın - Projects Portfolio

## Index

This repository holds all of my personal projects that I have done over the years. They are currently under two main categories.

1. [Cancer Bioinformatics Research](https://gitlab.com/cansuyalcin/projects_portfolio/-/tree/master/Cancer%20Bioinformatics%20Research "Research") 

2. [Personal Projects](https://gitlab.com/cansuyalcin/projects_portfolio/-/tree/master/Personal%20Projects "Projects") 

Every category has its own variety of projects and is accompanied by documentation.

## Background

Hi! This is Cansu Yalçın welcome to my Project Portfolio. Let me introduce myself. Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree in Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Degree in Medical Imaging and Applications (MAIA) with EMJMD full scholarship provided by Europian Union. MAIA program contains well detailed academic structure on AI technologies such as Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. 

I have graduated from Industrial Engineering and Computer Engineering (double major) at Antalya Bilim University ranking 2nd in my cohort and with a GPA of 3.65/4.00. Throughout my studies, I have completed several internships on such content as Data science, Data analytics, Machine learning, Deep learning, and Computer vision. I have been also part of the computational biology research group in my university for more than a year. During my research experience in this group, I worked on algorithms design and data analysis/visualizations to identify the significance of mutual exclusion and epistasis on genes across 8 different cancer subtypes using Python.
