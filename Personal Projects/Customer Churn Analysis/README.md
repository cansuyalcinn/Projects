# The customer churn analysis

This project aimed to analyze the loss of customers by employing and comparing several machine learning algorithms such as: random forest, naive bayes, KNN etc. Knime Analytics Platform and Python were used. Implementations were both made in Knime and Python. I have completed this project during one of my internships.
